In Savatthi\. At that time, five kings, led by King Pasenadi of Kosala, were enjoying themselves, being provided and endowed with five strands of sensual pleasure, during which the following conversation took place between them: "What is the most important sensual pleasure?"

One of them said: "Forms are the most important of sensual pleasures\."

Another said: "Sounds are the most important\."

Another: "Smells are the most important\."

Another: "Tastes are the most important\."

Another: "Tactile sensations are the most important\."

Since those kings could not convince each other, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to them: "Well, gentlemen, let's go to the Blessed One and ask him about this\. As he answers us, so we will remember it\."

"Good, sir" \- those kings answered\.

Then those five kings, led by King Pasenadi of Kosala, went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down nearby\.

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told the Blessed One about their entire conversation and asked: "So how, Lord, what is the most important of sensual pleasures?"

"Great king, I say that the most important of the five strands of sensual pleasure is determined by which is the most pleasant\. The same forms are pleasant to one person, great king, but unpleasant to another\. When he is satisfied and fully satisfied with some forms, then he does not thirst for other forms, more exalted and refined than these forms\. For him these forms turn out to be the highest\. For him these forms are unsurpassed\. The same sounds\.\.\. The same smells\.\.\. The same tastes\.\.\. The same tactile sensations are pleasant to one person, great king, but unpleasant to another\. When he is satisfied and fully satisfied with some tactile sensations, then he does not thirst for other tactile sensations, more exalted and refined than these tactile sensations\. For him these tactile sensations turn out to be the highest\. For him these tactile sensations are unsurpassed\."

And at that time, the layman Chandanangalika was sitting in that assembly\.

And then the layman Chandanangalika got up from his seat, threw his upper robe over his shoulder, and, raising his clasped palms in reverent greeting to the Blessed One, said to him: "Inspiration has descended upon me, Blessed One\! Inspiration has descended upon me, Happy One\!"

"In that case, express your inspiration, Chandanangalika\."

And then the layman Chandanangalika, in the presence of the Blessed One, praised him with this appropriate verse:

"Like a fragrant red lotus Kokanada,
That opens in the morning in its fragrance,
Such is Angirasa1,
He Who is Radiant,
He is like the sun, shining in the sky\."

And then those five kings gave five upper robes to that layman Chandanangalika\. But the layman Chandanangalika gave those five upper robes to the Blessed One\.
